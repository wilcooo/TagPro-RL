# TagPro-RLC

* Mimics the style of Rocket League's chat box
* Up to 8 older messages are shown again whenever a new message arrives for context
* Also when composing a chat, the context will be shown again
* Indicates whether you are typing a regular, team, group or moderator message.
* Links are clickable, long links are made shorter
* The userscript has a clear structure, so it is very easy to modify either the style (CSS), layout (HTML) or logic (JS). You're welcome.

## The future

* I might add an option that fades messages older than 20 seconds, because that's when they disappear for others.
* An option to hide common system messages. "*Since there aren't many players...*" etc.
* Other RL scripts, like RL Quick-Chat, RL Scoreboard and RL Interface, and one big script that combines this family.
